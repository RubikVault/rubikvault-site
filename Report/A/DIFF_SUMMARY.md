# Diff Summary (P0/P1 Hardening)

- `.github/workflows/eod-latest.yml`: Added fail-loud preflight, pulse generation, and strict mission-control blocking gate before commit/push.
- `.github/workflows/ops-daily.yml`: Added fail-loud preflight, pulse generation, and strict mission-control blocking gate before commit/push.
- `.github/workflows/ci-gates.yml`: Added artifact-level mission-control gate and optional preview/prod elliott parity gate.
- `.github/workflows/monitor-prod.yml`: Added semantic endpoint checks (`marketphase`, `elliott`, `mission-control`, `ops/pulse`) and core-artifact build_id cohesion gate.
- `functions/api/mission-control/summary.js`: Added severity policy integration and explicit `meta.status`, `meta.reason`, `meta.circuitOpen`, `meta.generatedAt`, `meta.build_id`, `meta.commit`.
- `functions/api/elliott-scanner.js`: Added policy-driven universe mode resolver and explicit meta contract (`mode`, `universeSource`, `universeCount`, `returnedCount`, `filtered`, `filterReason`, `build_id`, `commit`, `generatedAt`).
- `functions/data/marketphase/[asset].js`: New JSON fail-safe route for `/data/marketphase/*.json` with explicit circuit-open envelopes when static artifacts are missing.
- `public/index.html`: Elliott UI now surfaces explicit unavailable/circuit-open state instead of silent null rendering.
- `policies/mission-control-severity.json`: New blocking/degrading code policy for mission-control and gates.
- `policies/universe-policy.json`: New canonical universe mode/parity policy.
- `policies/cohesion-policy.json`: New core-artifact cohesion policy.
- `scripts/ops/preflight-check.mjs`: New preflight gate script with blocking checks and pulse write.
- `scripts/ops/build-ops-pulse.mjs`: New pulse generator from mission-control summary + severity mapping.
- `scripts/ci/assert-mission-control-gate.mjs`: New deploy gate for blocking mission-control conditions (strict/non-strict modes).
- `scripts/ci/check-elliott-parity.mjs`: New parity checker for preview/prod elliott contract invariants.
- `public/data/ops/pulse.json`: Added seed/committable pulse artifact with required schema/meta fields.
- `docs/ops/P0_P1_HARDENING_CONTRACTS.md`: Added concise documentation of contracts and gates introduced.
- `Report/A/FIX_REPORT.md`: Added implementation summary and safety rationale.
- `Report/A/EVIDENCE.md`: Added command-level evidence and verification excerpts.
- `Report/A/DIFF_SUMMARY.md`: Added file-by-file change intent map (this file).
