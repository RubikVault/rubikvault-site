PROOF — OPS gate policy + single verdict
Timestamp: 2026-02-04

Local tests run:
1) npm run test:contracts
   RESULT: PASS

2) npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops.spec.mjs
   RESULT: FAIL (baseURL defaults to https://rubikvault.com; new gate IDs not present pre-deploy)
   NOTE: rerun after deploy with BASE_URL=<preview>.

Suggested post-deploy verification (preview):
- BASE_URL="https://<preview>.pages.dev" npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops.spec.mjs
- curl -fsS "https://<preview>.pages.dev/api/mission-control/summary?debug=1" | jq '{metaStatus:.meta.status, gates:.data.gates.overall}'
Expected:
- meta.status == "ok" or "degraded" (not "error" unless contract break)
- data.gates.overall.status in ["GREEN","YELLOW","RED"]
