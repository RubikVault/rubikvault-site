# RubikVault MOAT

RubikVault combines static-first reliability with transparent model evidence.

## Why this matters

- Daily ranking logic is deterministic and reproducible.
- Every listed setup carries explainable engine signals.
- Derived views are generated from the same core artifact chain.

## Current focus

- Preserve correctness first: no empty publish over last known good data.
- Keep cross-engine consensus visible for every candidate.
- Surface market context and peer links directly on the stock detail workflow.

## Next expansion

- Broader idea families per regime.
- More explicit risk notes in each list entry.
- Continuous quality checks with fail-loud diagnostics.
