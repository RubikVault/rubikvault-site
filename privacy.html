    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This privacy notice explains, in a compact way, which personal data may be processed when you visit
      <strong>rubikvault.com</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Controller</h2>
    <p>
      RubikVault Project<br>
      Contact: <a href="mailto:contact@rubikvault.com">contact@rubikvault.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Basic principles</h2>
    <p>
      The site is operated as a lean, content-focused project. No user accounts, no login areas and no
      portfolio tracking features are offered. Personal data is only processed to the extent technically
      necessary for providing and protecting the website.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Server log files</h2>
    <p>
      When you access this website, the web server may automatically store information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address (in shortened or pseudonymised form where possible)</li>
      <li>Date and time of access</li>
      <li>Visited pages / requested files</li>
      <li>Browser type and version, operating system</li>
      <li>Referring URL (website from which the request originates)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used solely for ensuring the technical operation, stability and security of the site.
      Log files are automatically deleted after a limited retention period unless they are needed to clarify
      security incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies and tracking</h2>
    <p>
      The aim is to operate the site with as few cookies and external trackers as possible.
      Currently, no first-party tracking cookies are intentionally set.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, some embedded third-party widgets (especially TradingView and potentially video or social media
      embeds) may place their own cookies or use similar technologies. These are under the sole responsibility
      of the respective provider. Please refer to the providers’ privacy policies for details.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Embedded third-party content</h2>
    <p>
      This website integrates third-party content such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>TradingView market widgets (charts, tickers, economic calendar)</li>
      <li>Links to or embedded content from YouTube, X (Twitter), TikTok and Instagram</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you view such content, the respective providers may process personal data (e.g. IP address,
      device information, interaction data) under their own responsibility and according to their own
      terms and privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you contact the project by e-mail, the information you provide will be processed solely for handling
      the request and any necessary follow-up communication. E-mails are stored only as long as needed for
      documentation and legal obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on the applicable data protection law (e.g. GDPR in the European Union), you may have rights
      such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right of access to the personal data processed about you</li>
      <li>Right to rectification or deletion of your data</li>
      <li>Right to restriction of processing</li>
      <li>Right to object to certain processing activities</li>
      <li>Right to data portability</li>
